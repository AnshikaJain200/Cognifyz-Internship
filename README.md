Cognifyz Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the Cognifyz Data Analysis project README. In this project, we will be performing a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing restaurant information. The tasks are divided into three levels, each focusing on different aspects of the data. Below, we provide a detailed summary of each task's implementation and the rationale behind them.

Level 1
Task 1: Top Cuisines
Objective: Determine the top three most common cuisines in the dataset and calculate the percentage of restaurants that serve each of the top cuisines.

Implementation: We will first identify the most frequently occurring cuisines and then calculate the percentage of restaurants offering each of these cuisines. This analysis will provide insights into the popularity of cuisines in the dataset.

Task 2: City Analysis
Objective: Identify the city with the highest number of restaurants, calculate the average rating for restaurants in each city, and determine the city with the highest average rating.

Implementation: We will identify the city with the most restaurants and calculate the average rating for each city. This will help us understand the restaurant distribution and find the city with the highest-rated restaurants.

Task 3: Price Range Distribution
Objective: Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of price ranges among the restaurants and calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

Implementation: We will create a visual representation of the price range distribution and calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category. This analysis will give us insights into the pricing diversity within the dataset.

Task 4: Online Delivery
Objective: Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery and compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

Implementation: We will calculate the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery and analyze whether there is a significant difference in average ratings between restaurants with and without online delivery services.

Level 2
Task 1: Cuisine Combination
Objective: Identify the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset and determine if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

Implementation: We will analyze the dataset to identify common cuisine combinations and investigate if there is a correlation between specific combinations and higher ratings.

Task 2: Geographic Analysis
Objective: Plot the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates, and identify any patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

Implementation: We will use geographical coordinates to visualize the restaurant locations on a map and look for any spatial patterns or clusters, which can provide insights into the distribution of restaurants.

Task 3: Restaurant Chains
Objective: Identify if there are any restaurant chains present in the dataset and analyze the ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.

Implementation: We will identify restaurant chains within the dataset and analyze their ratings and popularity. This analysis will help us understand the performance of different restaurant chains.

Task 4: Restaurant Reviews
Objective: Analyze the text reviews to identify the most common positive and negative keywords and calculate the average length of reviews to explore any relationship between review length and rating.

Implementation: We will perform sentiment analysis on text reviews to identify common positive and negative keywords. Additionally, we will examine whether there is a correlation between review length and restaurant rating.


By completing these tasks at different levels, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the restaurant dataset. The analyses will help Cognifyz Technologies make data-driven decisions and gain valuable insights into the restaurant industry. Each task's results will be documented and shared in the project repository for further reference and anal
